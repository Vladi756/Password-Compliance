# Password-Compliance

Program in C to determine the characteristics of each character of a string, and to make sure it is a certain length. The code makes use of the <ctype.h> standard library of functions in C. This library has a wide array of useful functions that check whether their arguments are numbers, capital/lowecase letters, special symbols, etc. 

The program is very simple, it is less than 30 lines of code. It utilizes an if function as well as a control flow statement to allow the user to re - attempt to input their password, should it be incorrectly done the first time. 

The way the program works, it is set up to deal with 8 character long strings, this can obviously be changed to suit your individual needs.
